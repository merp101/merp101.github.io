  <h2> Controls </h2>
  <div> In order to move around, use the WASD keys. In case you do not know what that means, it means press A to go left, D to go right,    and (if applicable), S to go down and W to go up. However, S does nothing in this game, and W is the 'interact' key. That means that it is used to 1) talk to NPCs (non-playable characters), and 2) enter an area. <br> 
    Also, if you are fighting an enemy, you can use the number keys to use attacks (1 corresponds to the basic attack). </div> 
  <br> <br>
  
  <h2> Combat </h2>
  <div> During combat, you can see your character and the enemy, as well as yours and the enemy's stats. Whoever goes first is decided
    by your SPD stats. Whoever's is higher goes first. If you use an attack, which are on the left side of the screen, then you can      attack the enemy. After a short animation, you will deal damage to the enemy, based on buffs, your equipped weapon, and your stats. If you do not manage to defeat the enemy in one hit, then it will attack you back, based on its stats. Then, it will become your turn again. Once you manage to beat the enemy, it will drop an amount of gold that is based on the enemy's rarity. You may have noticed that the enemy has a name. Certain enemies are more common or rare than others, and the amount of gold they drop reflects that. Also, if you're lucky, you'll get an item to drop. Sometimes you can equip these items, but they are pretty rare. You will only get anything that dropped from enemies if you reach the end of the level. </div>
  <br> <br>
  
  <h2> NPCs </h2>
  <div> Once you beat the first level, you will get to the Village, which has two kind souls who are willing to help you on your journey to kill Satan - the Nurse and the Blacksmith. Keep in mind that you can ruin your relationships with these people, and if you do that, you will not be able to access their shops any more. Just don't be too mean, and you'll be fine. The Nurse will sell you various potions that will do a variety of things in battle - from heal you, to buff your stats, and... other things. In general, they won't do anything bad to you... You can also sell most anything to her - she'll use it somehow... The Blacksmith sells you weapons and armor, and you can sell your weaker gear to him for gold - he can break it down and make new weapons out of it, which you can buy. </div>
